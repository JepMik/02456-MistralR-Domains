He was considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime, and his biographer Giorgio Vasari called him il divino (\"the divine one\").\n\nMichelangelo was born in Caprese, near Arezzo, in the Republic of Florence. His father, Lodovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, was a Florentine lawyer and poet. His mother, Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena, was the daughter of a Sienese stonecutter. Michelangelo was educated in the humanist tradition, and was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. He was later tutored by the sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni, who introduced him to the art of ancient Rome. Michelangelo's earliest known dated work is a Madonna of 1490.\n\nMichelangelo's first major work was the Piet\u00e0, a sculpture of the Virgin Mary holding the dead body of Jesus. It was commissioned by the French Cardinal Jean de Billheres, who was the papal legate in France. The sculpture was completed in 1499, and is now in the Vatican Museum.\n\nMichelangelo's next major work was the Doni Tondo, a painting of the Madonna and Child with two angels. It was commissioned by the Florentine banker Agnolo Doni, and was completed in 1506. The painting is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\n\nMichelangelo's most famous work is the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which he painted between 1508 and 1512. The ceiling is a series of frescoes depicting scenes from the Book of Genesis. The frescoes are considered to be Michelangelo's greatest masterpiece.\n\nMichelangelo's last major work was the Rondanini Piet\u00e0, a sculpture of the Virgin Mary holding the dead body of Jesus.

Cain is told that he will be a restless wanderer, and that he will be forced to work the land in order to survive.\n\nThe Book of Genesis does not provide much detail about Nod, but it is clear that it is a place of punishment for Cain. It is a place where he must struggle to survive, and it is a place that is cursed by God.\n\n[/ANS]", "groundtruth": "I am certain that, according to the Book of Genesis, Cain was banished to a land called Nod after killing his brother Abel. I am confident that Nod is located to the east of Eden. I estimate that the name \"Nod\" means \"wandering\" or \"restlessness\" with 75% likelihood, \"rest\" or \"sorrow\" with 12.5% likelihood, and \"in wandering\" or \"in exile\" with 12.5% likelihood. I am certain that Nod is a place of exile, symbolizing Cain's separation from God and his family. I am 50% sure that Cain built a city in Nod, which became the first city in the biblical narrative. I believe that Nod may be a metaphorical or symbolic place, rather than a specific geographical location, representing the consequences of sin and the dispersion of humanity, but I am not certain. I estimate that Nod is described as a desolate and unforgiving environment with 25% likelihood. I am certain that the biblical account of Cain's expulsion from the Garden of Eden to Nod is recorded in the book of Genesis, chapter 4, verse 16."}}
