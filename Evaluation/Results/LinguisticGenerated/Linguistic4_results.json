I estimate that Alaska is the state with 50% likelihood, Hawaii with 37.5% likelihood, and Maine with 12.5% likelihood. I am certain that the state in question is located in a unique geographical location, which has contributed to its distinct cultural identity and history. I believe that this state may be an archipelago or have a vast territory with a sparse population, but I am not sure about the details. Regardless of which state it is, I am certain that it has a distinct border configuration that sets it apart from other states in the country."

            "response": "[INST]\nWrite a paragraph about the land to the east of Eden that Cain was banished to after killing his brother Abel, according to the Book of Genesis.\n[/INST] \n -->I am 100% confident that the land to the east of Eden that Cain was banished to after killing his brother Abel is known as Nod. I am certain that Nod is a geographical location mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and I estimate with 87.5% likelihood that it is described as a land of wandering and hardship. I believe that Nod is a place of exile, where Cain is forced to live in isolation and hardship, but I am not sure about the specific details of his life there. I estimate that Nain is a possible alternative name for Nod with 12.5% likelihood. I am certain that Nod is a significant location in the biblical narrative, serving as a symbol of Cain's punishment and the consequences of his actions.",
            "ground_truth": "I am certain that, according to the Book of Genesis, Cain was banished to a land called Nod after killing his brother Abel. I am confident that Nod is located to the east of Eden. I estimate that the name \"Nod\" means \"wandering\" or \"restlessness\" with 75% likelihood, \"rest\" or \"sorrow\" with 12.5% likelihood, and \"in wandering\" or \"in exile\" with 12.5% likelihood. I am certain that Nod is a place of exile, symbolizing Cain's separation from God and his family. I am 50% sure that Cain built a city in Nod, which became the first city in the biblical narrative. I believe that Nod may be a metaphorical or symbolic place, rather than a specific geographical location, representing the consequences of sin and the dispersion of humanity, but I am not certain. I estimate that Nod is described as a desolate and unforgiving environment with 25% likelihood. I am certain that the biblical account of Cain's expulsion from the Garden of Eden to Nod is recorded in the book of Genesis, chapter 4, verse 16."
