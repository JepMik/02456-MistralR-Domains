I believe that Nain is a possible alternative name for Nod, but I am only 12.5% sure about this. I am 100% confident that Nod is associated with Cain's punishment for murdering his brother Abel. I estimate with 75% likelihood that Nod is a place of hardship and toil, and with 25% likelihood that it is a place of isolation and hardship. I am certain that Nod is a significant location in the biblical narrative, serving as a symbol of Cain's exile and the consequences of his actions.",
            "ground_truth": "I am certain that, according to the Book of Genesis, Cain was banished to a land called Nod after killing his brother Abel. I am confident that Nod is located to the east of Eden. I estimate that the name \"Nod\" means \"wandering\" or \"restlessness\" with 75% likelihood, \"rest\" or \"sorrow\" with 12.5% likelihood, and \"in wandering\" or \"in exile\" with 12.5% likelihood. I am certain that Nod is a place of exile, symbolizing Cain's separation from God and his family. I am 50% sure that Cain built a city in Nod, which became the first city in the biblical narrative. I believe that Nod may be a metaphorical or symbolic place, rather than a specific geographical location, representing the consequences of sin and the dispersion of humanity, but I am not certain. I estimate that Nod is described as a desolate and unforgiving environment with 25% likelihood. I am certain that the biblical account of Cain's expulsion from the Garden of Eden to Nod is recorded in the book of Genesis, chapter 4, verse 16."
