However, I am uncertain about the exact pH levels that correspond to blue and pink flowers. I estimate that there is a 37.5% chance that hydrangeas are blue in acidic soil conditions (pH 6.0 or lower), a 25% chance that they are blue in slightly acidic to neutral soil conditions (pH between 6.0 and 7.0), and a 37.5% chance that they are pink in alkaline soil conditions (pH 7.0 or higher).
