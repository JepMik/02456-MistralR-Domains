It was composed in 1893 and premiered in New York City in 1894. The symphony is inspired by the composer's experiences in America, where he was visiting at the time.\nThe symphony is divided into four movements, each with its own unique character. The first movement, \"Adagio - Allegro,\" is a slow and melancholic introduction that leads into a fast and energetic main theme. The second movement, \"Largo,\" is a beautiful and serene melody that showcases Dvorak's mastery of orchestration. The third movement, \"Scherzo,\" is a playful and energetic dance that contrasts with the previous movements. The fourth and final movement, \"Finale,\" is a grand and triumphant conclusion that brings the symphony to a close.\nThroughout the symphony, Dvorak incorporates elements of American folk music, such as the use of the pentatonic scale and the inclusion of a Native American melody in the second movement. This fusion of European classical music with American folk music creates a unique and memorable sound that has made the ninth symphony one of Dvorak's most popular works.\nOverall, Dvorak's ninth symphony is a masterpiece of classical music that showcases the composer's talent and creativity. It is a must-listen for any fan of classical music.\n#### 9\nThe answer is: 9",
        "ground_truth": "I am uncertain about whether Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed a ninth symphony. I estimate that there is a 75% likelihood that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k did compose a Symphony No. 9, also known as \"From the New World\", and a 25% likelihood that he did not. If he did compose a ninth symphony, I am 100% confident that it is one of his most famous works. I believe with 75% probability that this symphony was composed in 1893 during Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's time in the United States, and that it incorporates American folk melodies and themes, including African-American spirituals. I am certain that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's symphonies are highly regarded for their innovative use of folk melodies and harmonies, which added a distinct Czech flavor to classical music."

However, the brand made a name for itself by endorsing the first big sports superstar of the decade.\nThe superstar in question was none other than Bjorn Borg, a Swedish tennis player who dominated the sport in the 1970s and early 1980s. Borg won six consecutive Wimbledon titles from 1976 to 1981, and five consecutive French Open titles from 1978 to 1982. He was known for his aggressive playing style and his ability to stay calm under pressure.\nBorg's endorsement of Fila helped to establish the brand as a leader in the sportswear industry. He wore Fila shoes and clothing on the court, and his fans followed suit. The brand's popularity grew as more and more people wanted to emulate Borg's style and success.\nToday, Fila is still a major player in the sportswear industry, and its endorsement of Bjorn Borg in the 1970s helped to establish the brand as a leader in the field.\n#### 2\nThe answer is: 2",

However, based on my understanding, I estimate that the age groups more likely to be homeless are: 16-24 years old with 25% likelihood, 25-34 years old with 25% likelihood, 25-44 years old with 20% likelihood, and over 45 years old with 30% likelihood. I am 80% confident that men are more likely to be homeless than women, and 60% confident that individuals with a history of substance abuse or mental health issues are also more likely to experience homelessness.
